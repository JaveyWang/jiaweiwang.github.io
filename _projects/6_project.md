Beauty product retrieval is a challenging task due to the severe
image variation issue in real-world scenes.

     Examples of beauty product retrieval problem. The query images are always vary from the database images, such as viewpoint variation, deformation, illumination conditions and background clutter.

In this work, to mitigate the data variation problem, we contribute a background-agnostic feature extractor, which is trained by a self-supervised salient object detection method.

In particular, we first propose a foreground augmentation technique to acquire the augmentation image with its foreground mask. Next, a feature extractor with an attention pooling layer is proposed to learn background-agnostic representations by performing the salient object detection in a self-supervised manner. Finally, we ensemble the background-agnostic features of multiple models to perform the beauty product retrieval.

    The graphical representation of our proposed framework, namely background-agnostic feature extractor, which is composed of the blocks of pre-trained network, mask encoder and attention pooling layer. The red line means upsample using 1 Ã— 1 convolution layer and a sigmoid activation. \( \mathcal{L} \) means the mean square error between mask prediction and mask label.

Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed framework.
