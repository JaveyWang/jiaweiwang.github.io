Hello. I am a PhD student at Hunan University, leading an interest research group in Deep Learning and Causal Inference. Our group's goal is to leverage the theory of causal inference to address the problems of bias in the nowadays deep learning framework. My [projects page](/jiaweiwang.github.io/projects/) provides a more detailed and up-to-date overview of this effort. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, and any undergraduate and graduate students interested in this are welcome to join our seminar group.
