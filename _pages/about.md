Hello. I am a PhD student at Hunan University, leading an interest research group in Deep Learning and Causal Inference. Our group's goal is to leverage the theory of causal inference to address the problems of bias in the nowadays deep learning framework. My [projects page](/jiaweiwang.github.io/projects/) provides a more detailed and up-to-date overview of this effort. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, and any undergraduate and graduate students interested in this are welcome to join our seminar group.

<!-- My current research interests include Causal Inference, Multimodal Learning and Representation Learning. I have published academic papers in the most influentialÂ conferences such as ACMMM, NeurIPS, and EMNLP. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
